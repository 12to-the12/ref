1. you should be using a text programming language (python not scratch)
2. you should be using Python 3 not Python 2
3. you should be using a real IDE (VS code not Trinket)
4. you should be using version control (Github not Trinket)
4. you should be using type hints & exception handling
5. you should be using a compiled language for intensive calcs (Rust not Python)
