[software design pattern](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Software_design_pattern)
- never rewrite from scratch
- fail fast
### unix

- Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
- Write programs to work together.
- Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
- simplicity, minimalism


- Make it easy to write, test, and run programs.
- Interactive use instead of batch processing.
- Economy and elegance of design due to size constraints.

### extended unix philosophy

- Build modular programs
- Write readable programs
- Use composition
- Separate mechanisms from policy
- Write simple programs
- Write small programs
- Write transparent programs
- Write robust programs
- Make data complicated when required, not the program
- Build on potential users' expected knowledge
- Avoid unnecessary output
- Write programs which fail in a way that is easy to diagnose
- Value developer time over machine time
- Write abstract programs that generate code instead of writing code by hand
- Prototype software before polishing it
- Write flexible and open programs
- Make the program and protocols extensible.

### The Zen of Python

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
