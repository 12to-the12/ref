## overview
this is where I'll keep all the snippets and best practices and things I need to remember when developing software



## development pipeline
 1. design
	- flowcharts
	- designate mvp & features
 2. build
	- repo, crate/virtual enviroment
 	- write out in comments
	- decide on naming schema
	- build out the ui
	- hardcode values for testing
	- gradually fill in functionality
 3. improve
	- refactor
	- 
 4. test
	- review / get reviewed
	- unit tests
	- beta release
 5. document

 a miscellaneous tip: python modules make wonderful single instance
 classes, something I learned recently.
 - They have their own namespace
 - attributes and methods are accessible through the dot operator
 - and you don't even need to mess around with class boilerplate!
